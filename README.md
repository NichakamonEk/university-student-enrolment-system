# University Student Enrolment System — Software Development Project

- Software development project focused on translating requirements into a structured system design and implementation  
- Demonstrates structured software thinking from problem definition to a working application  
- Emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and alignment between design decisions and implementation  

---

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a **university student enrolment system**.  
The objective is to translate business and user requirements into a structured software solution, covering **requirements analysis, system design, and implementation**.

The project was developed as part of a fundamentals of software development course, with a strong focus on **design logic, system structure, and reasoning**, rather than algorithmic complexity.

---

## Problem Context
Universities require systems that manage student enrolment processes efficiently, consistently, and transparently.

The system aims to support:
- Student enrolment and subject selection  
- Clear validation of enrolment rules  
- Maintainable system logic that can be extended over time  

---

## Requirements Analysis
- Identification of **functional requirements** (e.g. enrolment actions, data handling)  
- Identification of **non-functional requirements** (e.g. usability, clarity, maintainability)  
- Translation of requirements into system components, rules, and interactions  

---

## System Design
- Use case modelling to represent user interactions with the system  
- Class design applying **object-oriented principles**  
- Clear separation of responsibilities across system components  
- Design decisions documented to support readability and future extensibility  

---

## Implementation
- Implemented using **Python**  
- Object-oriented programming approach (classes and methods)  
- Command-line interface (CLI) and/or basic graphical interface (GUI)  
- Input validation and basic error handling to support reliable execution  

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Applying structured thinking to software problem-solving  
- Translating requirements into system design decisions  
- Implementing software aligned with design specifications  
- Understanding the importance of maintainable and readable code  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- UML diagrams (Use Case, Class Diagram)  
- Basic CLI / GUI development  

---

## Repository Contents
- [`/src`](./src) — Source code for the student enrolment system and run instructions  
- `/docs` — Requirement analysis and system design report  

---

## Notes
This project demonstrates a **foundational software development workflow**, highlighting the ability to analyse requirements, design system architecture, and implement a working solution in a clear and structured manner.  
The focus is on **software reasoning, design quality, and traceability**, which are critical in consulting and technology-advisory contexts.
