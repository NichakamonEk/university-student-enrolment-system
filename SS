# University Student Enrolment System — Software Development Project

▪️ Software development project focused on requirements analysis, system design, and implementation  
▪️ Demonstrates structured software thinking from problem definition to working application  
▪️ Emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and alignment between design and implementation

## ▸ Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a **university student enrolment system**.  
The objective is to translate business and user requirements into a structured software solution, covering **requirement analysis, system design, and implementation**.

The project was developed as part of a fundamentals of software development course, with a strong focus on **design logic and software structure**, rather than algorithmic complexity.

---

## ▸ Problem Context
Universities require a system to manage student enrolment processes efficiently and consistently.

The system aims to support:
- Student enrolment and subject selection
- Clear validation of enrolment rules
- Maintainable system logic that can be extended in the future

---

## ▸ Requirements Analysis
- Identification of **functional requirements** (e.g. enrolment actions, data handling)
- Identification of **non-functional requirements** (e.g. usability, clarity, maintainability)
- Translation of requirements into system components and interactions

---

## ▸ System Design
- Use case design to represent user interactions with the system
- Class design using **object-oriented principles**
- Clear separation of responsibilities across system components
- Design decisions documented to support readability and future extension

---

## ▸ Implementation
- Implemented using **Python**
- Object-oriented programming approach (classes and methods)
- Command-line interface (CLI) and/or basic graphical interface (GUI)
- Input validation and basic error handling

---

## ▸ Key Learning Outcomes
- Applying structured thinking to software problem-solving
- Translating requirements into system design
- Implementing software based on design specifications
- Understanding the importance of maintainable and readable code

---

## ▸ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- UML diagrams (Use Case, Class Diagram)
- Basic CLI / GUI development

---

## ▸ Repository Contents
- System design documentation (UML diagrams)
- Source code for the enrolment system
- Supporting explanation of design and implementation
